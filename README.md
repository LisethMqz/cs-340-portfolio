# cs-340-portfolio
Portfolio repository for CS 340 featuring a MongoDB backed dashboard application and supporting CRUD module.

Throughout this course I learned how important it is to write programs that are readable, maintainable, and adaptable by keeping code organized and reusable. This was especially clear when I created the CRUD Python module in Project One and then reused it in Project Two to connect the dashboard widgets to the database. Having the database logic separated into its own module made the code easier to understand and update since changes only needed to be made in one place. This approach also made building the dashboard smoother and helped reduce mistakes. In the future this CRUD module could be reused for other MongoDB based projects such as dashboards, reporting systems, or applications for different clients. When working on the Grazioso Salvare project I approached the problem by first understanding the requirements and then breaking the project into smaller steps like designing the database, writing queries, and connecting everything to the dashboard. This project felt different from earlier assignments because it focused on solving a real world problem and thinking about how all parts of the system work together instead of just completing a single task. Computer scientists build systems that help organizations store and analyze data in useful ways and this matters because it allows companies to work more efficiently and make better decisions. This project shows how a well designed database and dashboard can turn raw data into useful information and help a company like Grazioso Salvare do their work faster and more effectively.
